### About Paul

I help organisations in the domains of Digital Transformation, Requirements Engineering, Systems Integration & Software Engineering. During my career, I have integrated many services and legacy systems into scalable, customer-centric applications. 

I have been educated in a broad range of quantitative and qualitative skills at three European universities.
My work or work that I have contributed to has been published in peer-reviewed and renowned journals within the respective fields. Software systems that I have architected and helped to build are used in production to date, generating significant revenues.
I am fluent in German, English, and Swedish. In addition, I am more or less fluent in Kotlin, Groovy, Java, Scala, PHP, Elixir, Javascript and a range of SQL dialects. 

### Skills & Experience

I consider myself a 'full-stack software engineer and business analyst'. I have a wide range of skills from requirements engineering, software engineering, business analysis and project management methodologies. I started writing code when I was 12 - the time I got my first Mac with HyperCard.

I have learned to dynamically deal with shifting priorities and expectations in uncertain environments.
