### ðŸ‘¨ About

My interest is the area of Requirements Engineering, Product Management, Systems Integration & Software Engineering in customer-centric and service-based industries - I like to solve problems through people, processes and technology with an agile mindset and empathy. I have more than 10 years of experience in developing and managing mission-critical digital products at scale in the hospitality and insurance industry.
 
I have been educated in a broad range of quantitative and qualitative skills at three European universities in Germany, Sweden, and England.
My work or work that I have contributed to has been published in peer-reviewed and recognized journals within their respective fields. Products that I have architected and shipped are used by real customers at scale, generating significant transaction volumes.
I am fluent in German, English, and Swedish. In addition, I am more or less fluent in Kotlin, Groovy, Java, Scala, PHP, Elixir, Javascript and a range of SQL dialects. The idea to build things that have a positive impact on the lifes of people like you and me is what drives me at work.

Outside of work, I like to spend my free time with running (I've recently gotten into running half marathons), reading sci-fi books and stuff about psychology, cooking, playing guitar and music in general. I tend to - for better or worse - absorb knowledge like a sponge, there is probably nothing I am not interested in or can not get excited about.

### ðŸ’» Skills & Experience

I consider myself a 'full-stack software engineer and business analyst with a focus on cloud technologies'. I have a wide range of skills from requirements engineering, software engineering, business analysis and project management methodologies. I grew up with the internet in the 90s and started writing code when I was 12 - the time I got my first Mac with HyperCard. For nostalgic reasons, have an 'under construction' gif:

I have learned to dynamically deal with shifting priorities and expectations in highly uncertain environments.

#### ðŸ’¼ Practice 
* Product Manager at <a href="https://www.uncharted.global">Uncharted</a> (Current).
* Head of Software Development at <a href="https://www.hepster.com">hepster.com</a>, where I build a scalable, cloud-based insurance distribution platform. I helped the business by architecting and implementing a cloud-native infrastructure based on Spring Boot & Kotlin, AWS, Docker, Laravel, and Vue.js and coaching the delivery team. I turned high-level ideas and visions into technical product roadmaps and concrete deliverables using methodologies like impact mapping and "Discover to Deliver". Spearheaded the transition from project-based delivery into product-based thinking. Spearheaded the transition from a project organisation to a strong product organisation (Oct. 2017 - Jan. 2021).
* Systems Analyst AIDA Cruises' <a href="https://www.costadigital.io">Digital Unit</a>, where I helped with the integration of Digital Products into legacy systems infrastructures as part of the organization's Digital Transformation. I was primarily involved in building decision support systems for call centers and the group's expansion into the Chinese market. I also got to spend some time in Shanghai which was a great experience. (Oct. 2016 - Oct. 2017).
* Business Analyst Reservations & Electronic Channels at <a href="https://www.aida.de">AIDA Cruises</a>, where I was responsible for the internet booking platforms and the electronic channels (B2C - B2B) connected to it. I primarily dealed with the integration of legacy reservation systems, requirements engineering and architecting a mission-critical Java stack based on Spring & Hibernate handling high transaction volumes. This included close collaboration with stakeholders in Europe and the United States across the whole product lifecycle (Nov. 2011 - Oct. 2016).
* Project Manager for a business-to-business marketing analysis project for a major cruise line in the DACH travel market.
* Research Assistant for the programme in (International) Cruise Industry Management at the Bremerhaven University of Applied Sciences.
* Internship at the "Touristikverband Rotenburg WÃ¼mme e.V.", where I implemented a county-wide internet reservation system.

#### ðŸŽ“ Research & Other Contributions
My work or work that I have contributed to has been published in peer-reviewed and renowned journals within the respective fields. I have been educated in a broad range of quantitative and qualitative skills at three European universities. I also do side projects, mostly to scratch own itches and stay on top of current technologies. 

##### Open Source
* <a href="https://github.com/j-easy/easy-rules">**easy-rules**</a>. I contributed the ability to read MVEL rules from strings using a _java.io.Reader_ to easy-rules, a simple rules engine for Java.
* <a href="https://github.com/paulbrejla/Ferien-api">**ferien-api**</a>. I built a small service based on Spring Boot, Kotlin, and Jetty that exposes German school holidays via a RESTful API

My aim is to participate more in OSS in the future.
