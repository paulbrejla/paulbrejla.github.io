### About Paul

My interest is the area of Requirements Engineering, Systems Integration & Software Engineering. As a certified professional for requirements engineering (Advanced Level), I hold a 'Black Belt' in model-based Requirements Engineering.

My interests are located at the intersection between end customers, business processes, enterprise integration patterns, model-driven requirements engineering, software engineering, and technology acceptance. I have been educated in a broad range of quantitative and qualitative skills at three European universities.

My work or work that I have contributed to has been published in peer-reviewed and renowned journals within the respective fields.
I am fluent in German, English, and Swedish. In addition, I am more or less fluent in Python, Kotlin, Groovy, Java, Scala, Elixir, Javascript and a range of SQL dialects. 

### Skills & Experience

I consider myself a 'full-stack software engineer and business analyst'. I have a wide range of skills from requirements engineering, software engineering, business analysis and project management methodologies. I started writing code when I was 12 - the time I got my first Mac with HyperCard.

I have learned to dynamically deal with shifting priorities and expectations in uncertain environments.

#### Research & Other Contributions
My work or work that I have contributed to has been published in peer-reviewed and renowned journals within the respective fields. I have been educated in a broad range of quantitative and qualitative skills at three European universities. I also do side projects, mostly to scratch own itches and stay on top of current technologies. 

##### Open Source
* **easy-rules**. I contributed the ability to read MVEL rules from strings using a java.io.Reader to easy-rules, a simple rules engine for Java.

#### Projects
* **Kreuzfahrt-Gurus.de**. I built a scalable, cloud-native backend for frontend infrastructure based on Spring Boot and Kotlin. I also developed vuejs components. (http://www.kreuzfahrt-gurus.de)
* **Ferien-Api.de**. I built a small service based on Spring Boot, Kotlin, and Jetty that exposes German school holidays via a RESTful API. (https://www.ferien-api.de)
