My interest is the area of Requirements Engineering, Systems Integration & Software Engineering. As a certified professional for requirements engineering (Advanced Level), I hold a 'Black Belt' in model-based Requirements Engineering.

My interests are located at the intersection between end customers, business processes, enterprise integration patterns, model-driven requirements engineering, software engineering, and technology acceptance. I have been educated in a broad range of quantitative and qualitative skills at three European universities.

My work or work that I have contributed to has been published in peer-reviewed and renowned journals within the respective fields.
I am fluent in German, English, and Swedish. In addition, I am more or less fluent in UML 2, Python, Kotlin, Groovy, Java, Scala, Elixir, and a range of SQL dialects.
